"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.
 Now you see me, now you don't. George thinks he will, but I know he won't."
 "Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth."
"I'm young; I'm handsome; I'm fast. I can't possibly be beat."
“It isn’t the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it’s the pebble in your shoe.”
"I am the greatest, I said that even before I knew I was."
"I'm so mean, I make medicine sick."
"I shook up the world. Me! Whee!"
